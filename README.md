## Manual Installation

For normal users, installing via the installers makes the most sense. However when wanting to either develop BetterDiscord, or when the installers do not work, this option can be used.

**Prerequisites**: [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x+ and the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp.git`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build both the Injector and Renderer bundles with `npm run build` this will create a `injector.js`, `preload.js`, and `renderer.js` in the `dist` folder.
4. Run the inject script to inject the local files into your Discord client (`npm run inject`). Alternately install it to non-stable using `npm run inject canary`.

# FAQ

### What is this?
This is a client modification for Discord. It allows you to add plugins and themes to your client. Plugins can add functionality and useful features. Themes can completely change the look and feel of Discord.

BD has some other built-in features such as Emotes from Twitch, FFZ, and BBTV, as well as an in-client server browser.

### Where can I get plugins and themes?
In our support servers we have channels with lists of <u>official</u> plugins and themes. Please note we do not have an official listing on a website and are **not affiliated with any of those websites**. However [BetterDiscordLibrary](https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/) is generally trustworthy.

### Support Servers?
There are two: [The main server](https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbORCRqbAd), and [the backup](https://discord.gg/2HScm8j).
